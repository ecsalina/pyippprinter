# pyippprinter
Implements enough of the IPP (internet printing protocol) to emulate a network printer.

IPP version supported is IPP Everywhere.

Based on guide https://www.pwg.org/ipp/ippguide.html and https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippig20-20150821-5100.19.pdf, as well as the formal spec here: https://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippeve10-20130128-5100.14.pdf.


Mostly an excuse to learn about the internet printing protocol. Implemented with django and waitress. Tested on Fedora 29 and Windows 10.
